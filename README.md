# Convergence results in image interpolation with the continuous SSIM 
This repository contains the code to replicate the experiments of the paper

> F. Marchetti and G. Santin, _Convergence results in image interpolation with the continuous SSIM_ (2021).



## Code overview

To test the code, you can run one of the three examples:

* [Example1_linear_and_bicubic_interpolation.ipynb](Example1_linear_and_bicubic_interpolation.ipynb): Example of kernel interpolation.
* [Example2_kernel_interpolation.ipynb](Example2_kernel_interpolation.ipynb): Example of bilinear and bicubic interpolation.
* [Example3_image_interpolation.ipynb](Example3_image_interpolation.ipynb): Example of bilinear and bicubic interpolation applied to images.



## Dependencies and sources

The file [kernels.py](kernels.py) is taken from the [VKOGA](https://github.com/GabrieleSantin/VKOGA) package.

A complete list of dependencies can be found in the file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
